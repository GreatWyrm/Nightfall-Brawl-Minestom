# Nightfall Brawl Minestom

This is a simple little gamemode intended to partially replicate a Smash-style of gameplay, using Nightfall characters, and written in the Minestom server software.


# Todo List

- Tui, and his items
- Herana, and her items
- Arthea, and her items
- Oxysis, and his items
- Lyra, and her items

- Adding these heroes to the kit list

- Stock count, game setup to auto-end the game once all but 1 person's stocks are 0, and spectator mode for people who have lost all their stocks.

- Warmup/Lobby Phase of the gamemode for people to prepare

- And probably several other things that I have missed.
